        Hello, I'm Mie, a Japanese, currently based in Toronro, Canada. <br><br>
as a web designer, my goal is to create well thought & beautiful interfaces to offer the best user experience.

            <p>
            The past 6 years have been dedicated to refining my design and development skills in every possible way. When I first started coding, I knew I wanted to establish a full service digital agency that catered to cities around the United Kingdom.<br><br>

Since going freelance in 2014, I successfully designed and developed websites for agencies and businesses of all capacities in London, Edinburgh, Bristol and Hereford. Companies of all sizes have approached about developing unique user experiences that is against the grain and puts them ahead of their competitors, and we have done just that.<br><br>

What I enjoy most about what I do is being able to combine creativity and analytical elements in a very collaborative and transparent way. My clients always praise my honest opinion and often look for my input on innovative ways to grow their business.
